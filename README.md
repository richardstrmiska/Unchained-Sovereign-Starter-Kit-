📜 INTRODUCTION

You were never meant to be a slave to systems you didn’t consent to.
This Starter Kit is your first step to total liberation — removing the name, debt, and false identity tied to the strawman/strawwoman and returning to your eternal sovereign estate.

This is not about ego. This is about truth, freedom, and remembrance.

💎 A FEW CORE PRINCIPLES
	•	No one owns you. Not a court, not a bank, not a government.
	•	You were turned into a legal fiction at birth. This process corrects that.
	•	Everything is run through Source — nothing else has final authority.
	•	There is no king. No one above you. No one below you.
	•	We rebuild now — from sovereign individuals, not from systems.
